Cohere has launched an agricultural social enterprise in Rwamwanja Settlement. The enterprise centres around a maize mill and a 20-acre farm. Revenue from the social enterprise is used to support Cohere’s existing work with refugee-led organisations as well as provide holistic support to local refugee and host community farmers through building stronger market linkages and offering extension services. In the first year we aim to procure and mill 30 tonnes of grain per month and retail flour from a small shop and wholesale to larger buyers.  \
