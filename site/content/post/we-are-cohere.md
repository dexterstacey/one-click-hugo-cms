  identity. Cohere brings together a diverse group of people all united in one
  belief – that everyone, especially refugees, should have control over their
  future, on their terms. "

The launch of Cohere marks the coming together of Xavier Project and Urban Refugees - two organisations founded on similar principles and committed to supporting the growth of refugee-led organisations through coordination; capacity strengthening; direct funding; and advocacy. In recent years, leaders in refugee communities have finally been recognised for the important work they do in leading the response to refugee crises around the world. We have been partnering with refugee-led organisations in East Africa since 2008. We have learnt that refugees should be in control when it comes to decisions that affect their lives. Last year, our 25 RLO partners were able to support over 24,479 refugees and members of the host community with crucial services and access to meaningful opportunities. Our partners, [YIDA](https://reframe.network/profile.php?org=YIDA), who run social l enterprise activities in Kyaka settlement in Uganda, have been able to support over 600 young children with nursery education.They are fuelling futures in their communities. 

We know there are other people out there that believe that there are better ways to respond to global refugee crises. Who, like us, believe that change is possible.Changes that would give refugees the power to control the resources and make the decisions that affect them. 

At Cohere, we’re on a mission to unleash the potential of refugees to determine their own futures on their own terms. Will you join us?
