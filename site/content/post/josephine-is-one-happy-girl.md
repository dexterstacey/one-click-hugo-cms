Seven-year-old Josephine is one of the many children across Uganda who received an assistive device in our All-in-All Learning Programme with Comic Relief and UK Aid for children living with physical disabilities. Over one hundred and fifty childrengot tailored devices that will assist in meeting their physical and mobility needs.

Josephine lives in Imvepi Refugee Settlement with her mother and siblings and is set to join school in 2022. Children likeJosephine require constant care and support, and we are glad this project seeks to empower their primary caregivers and the community at large with knowledge and resources on how best to support their needs.
