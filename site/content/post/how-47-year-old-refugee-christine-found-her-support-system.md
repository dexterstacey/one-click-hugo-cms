47-year-old Christine is a refugee in Uganda who came across refugee-led organisation, [Tomorrow Vijana](http://www.tomorrowvijana.org/) a few years after fleeing Congo with her family. She had no knowledge of English but was encouraged to join a savings group. Afterwards, the Tomorrow Vijana team began teaching English to the group under a tree. Since they did not have a physical class, they would hang learning materials on branches. What started as a savings group led her to learn English and start interacting with different people. Christine now works as an Outreach Worker for Tomorrow Vijana, providing emotional and social support to refugee communities in Rwamwanja. 

Christine says, “I encourage refugee families to join communities and organisations where they can learn. Either skills, languages or more since education does not have to end when one is a refugee. Finding a good support system is what we need and mine has been Tomorrow Vijana.”

Tomorrow Vijana is one of our refugee-led organisation partners serving communities in Rwamwanja refugee settlement, Uganda. It was founded by  refugees for refugees. They work to ensure refugee communities are self-reliant through the provision of education and skills, economic empowerment, enhanced livelihoods and promotion of health.
