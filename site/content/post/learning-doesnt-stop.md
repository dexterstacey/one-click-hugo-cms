Flavia Namwanga is a determined mother of four children and an active participant in a learning program that we run together with our refugee-led partner [Solidarity Initiative for Refugees (SIR)](https://sirafrica.org/). Before joining the program, Flavia lost out on many opportunities for skills training because she could not leave her children unattended. Finding a safe environment to leave them was difficult.

SIR recently set up a creche facility to help mothers like Flavia attend the training while their children are left in the care of a babysitter. Flavia does not worry about the well-being of her children while in class. After class, she gets them back when they are well fed and energised from playing with other children. She has also been able to provide for herself and her children from online freelancing jobs that she got after taking the training.

“I encourage all women to attend because we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; let us not be intimidated by the community's belief that we can't have a good future because we have children to care for. Women with children need to be supported so that they do not miss out on opportunities like these,” says Flavia.
