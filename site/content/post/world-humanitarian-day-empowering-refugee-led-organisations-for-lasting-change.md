***Frontline Responders: Heroes Among Us***

Frontline responders, often referred to as the unsung heroes of humanitarian efforts, are individuals who dedicate their lives to assisting their own communities who have been affected by conflicts, disasters, and emergencies. These brave individuals , be they medical professionals, aid workers, or volunteers, often risk their own safety to provide life-saving assistance, comfort, and hope to those in dire need. Their commitment to transforming their communities by providing essential services, and offering psychological support is inspiring. 
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the vital role that refugee-led organisations play in humanitarian responses. Refugees themselves possess an intimate understanding of the challenges and needs their communities face, making them uniquely equipped to provide relevant support. By strengthening these organisations, we can foster a more sustainable and effective approach to humanitarian assistance that enables them to lead their own solutions



***Understanding the Needs on a Deeper Level***

Refugee-led organisations offer a powerful advantage in humanitarian work. They understand the needs of their communities better than anyone and are able to base their interventions on their own knowledge and experience. Having lived through displacement and adversity, refugees possess firsthand insights into the challenges faced by their fellow refugees. This allows them to design interventions that are not only more effective but also resonate with their communities' cultures and nuanced emotional needs
Supporting refugee-led organisations goes beyond just providing immediate relief; it's about building long-term resilience within communities. These organisations are often embedded in the fabric of their communities, allowing them to foster connections, provide psychosocial support, and help individuals regain a sense of agency over their lives. By entrusting refugees with the resources and tools to drive change, they can rebuild their lives and contribute to the growth and development of their communities.



***Championing Local Solutions***

Transferring aid and funds directly to refugee-led organisations is a powerful way to champion local solutions. It bypasses bureaucratic hurdles and ensures that resources reach those who need them promptly. This approach recognizes the expertise and capacity that exists within the communities themselves, moving away from the top-down model of humanitarian aid delivery to a more inclusive and participatory approach. An example of such an approach is through the creation of a platform called [Reframe](https://reframe.network/). The platform currently supports over 300 refugee-led organisations and increases their access to direct funding, raises awareness of their existence and work, builds networks and strengthens coordination between RLOs, INGOs, donors and institutional bodies.   We did this with the acknowledgement that traditional humanitarian organisations can provide technical expertise, resources, and networks that can complement the grassroots efforts of refugee-led organisations, creating a synergy that enhances the overall response.



As we commemorate World Humanitarian Day, let us take a moment to appreciate the tireless efforts of frontline responders who embody the principles of compassion and solidarity. Let us also recognise the immense potential of refugee-led organisations to drive positive change within their communities. By transferring aid and funds directly to these organisations, they can amplify their impact and work towards a world where the most vulnerable are not just recipients of assistance, but active agents of change. When refugees lead, communities are transformed.
