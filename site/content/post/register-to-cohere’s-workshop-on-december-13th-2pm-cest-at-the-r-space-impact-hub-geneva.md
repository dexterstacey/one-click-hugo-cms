There is growing encouragement for refugee response organizations to embark on an ‘internal learning journey’, where we learn what we need to do to promote refugee leadership, and *unlearn* problematic behaviors that breed exclusion. But what does this mean in practice, and where do we begin? How can we avoid common pitfalls and instead ensure our learning turns to action?  Join us to find out.

This session will provide space for 40 fellow refugee response practitioners, academics, and funders to unpack and workshop around the key pathways shared by our experts during the [first session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPBjlwG7ugI) of Cohere’s five-part interactive workshop series “Building Organizational Pathways towards Meaningful Refugee Participation and Refugee Leadership”. 

Join us! 

Title: **Organizational Pathways Towards Meaningful Participation and Refugee Leadership: Launching Equity Learning Journeys**

Date: **13th, December**

Venue: **Le Petit Salon, R-space, Geneva Impact Hub.**

Context:

In October 2023, Cohere launched a five-part Interactive Workshop Series free of charge for fellow refugee response practitioners, academics and funders.  In contrast to other spaces that are focused on meaningful participation in external engagement, *this Interactive Workshop Series is focused on what our own organizations need to do in-house to operate with equity and integrity*. Afterall, the pursuit of meaningful participation is about rectifying historic exclusion. What better place to start to address this than at home?

Cohere humbly **acknowledges that it is on its own equity learning journey**. We are taking a hard look at ourselves and trying to uncover what we need to improve in order to be a part of an equitable and effective refugee response sector.

This Interactive Workshop Series is for anyone who wants to support their organization to take concrete steps in supporting refugee leadership and meaningful participation. Each session is co-organized with an expert or set of experts, many of whom have personally experienced forced displacement, on the topics that can support our collective learning and growing. Our key topics will be as follows:

1. October 2023: *[Internal equity learning journeys ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPBjlwG7ugI)*
2. November 2023: *[Recruitment and hiring of people of forced displacement ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53g3yf2f7_k)*
3. January 2024: Equitable partnerships with RLOs
4. February 2024: Funding and institutional support to RLOs 
5. March 2024: Refugee-led advocacy

The session in Geneva will allow participants to actively workshop challenges and pathways to navigate Internal Learning Journeys, engage in discussions about application of pathways, and leave with concrete, actionable steps, to inform their organization’s pursuit of meaningful Participation and Refugee Leadership.
