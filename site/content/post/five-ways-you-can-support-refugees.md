Worldwide there are now over **100 million displaced people**. Every day that number is growing. Everyone deserves a future on their own terms, especially refugees. At Cohere, we believe that when power is transferred to refugees their communities can be transformed by them. Here are five ways you can support refugees any day:

* **[Make a donation](https://cohere.enthuse.com/donate#!/)** - to celebrate World Refugee Day, make a donation and support our work with refugee-led organisations.
* **[Follow our work](https://www.instagram.com/wearecohere_org/)** - find out more about how refugee-led organisations are transforming their communities. Follow us on Instagram.
* **[Plan a fundraiser](https://cohere.enthuse.com/fundraising/start#!/)** - sign up to a 10km, organise a bake sale, or organise a raffle. Every penny you raise will impact refugees' lives.
* **[Become a regular donor](https://cohere.enthuse.com/donate#!/)** -  a small donation each month goes a long way in helping us achieve our mission.
* **[Join the conversation](https://twitter.com/WeAreCohere_Org)** - advocacy is an important part of our work. We want more people to know the challenges that refugees are facing and how they are delivering the right solutions. Share our posts on Twitter.

Your money can support a refugee like Flavia Namanga based in Kakuma Refugee Camp. Flavia is a determined mother and participant in the learning program we run in partnership with our refugee-led organisation partner, Solidarity Initiative for Refugees. Thanks to supporters like you, Flavia will be able to do online freelancing jobs that will boost her income and help her provide for her children.
