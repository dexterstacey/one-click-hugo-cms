**About us**\
At Cohere we want to see a world in which everyone has control over their own future. Especially refugees. Our mission is to unleash the potential of refugees to determine their own futures on their own terms. No one chooses to live a life of dependency. That’s why our vision isn’t to transfer aid. It’s to transfer power.\
\
Cohere is transforming communities by transferring power within the response to refugee crises. To make the most effective and sustainable change within communities, we work closely together with local refugee led organisations (RLOs), who know exactly what's needed to address the challenges their communities face. RLOs are building stronger communities and forging a path towards self-reliance in refugee hosting areas. We follow their lead so local leaders can make the decisions that affect refugee communities.\
\
Cohere’s role in achieving this is to strengthen and share capacity with refugee and host community leaders, channel funding to refugee led initiatives, support initiatives to network and co-ordinate local leadership structures and to advocate for a transformation of the global response to forced displacement.\
\
Cohere has been an instrumental founder of the RLO platform www.reframe.network. The platform is designed to profile the work of RLOs (currently almost 100), presenting their work in a way that is consistent and easy to navigate. Reframe also provides a way to share opportunities within a network of RLOs and enable refugee leaders to connect. Currently there are initiatives underway to facilitate the flow of funding to RLOs through Reframe as well as integrated project management.
