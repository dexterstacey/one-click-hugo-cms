**Educate Yourself and Raise Awareness:**

Ignorance breeds indifference, while knowledge fosters empathy and understanding. Take the initiative to educate yourself about the refugee crisis, its causes, and the experiences of displaced individuals. Read books, watch documentaries, and follow reputable news sources to stay informed. Use your knowledge to raise awareness within your social circle, schools, workplaces, and local communities. By dispelling misconceptions and promoting understanding, you can help build a more inclusive society.

**Show Empathy and Welcome Refugees:**

The simplest yet most powerful gesture you can offer is empathy and kindness. Create a welcoming environment by reaching out to refugees in your community. Offer friendship, support, and assistance in navigating their new surroundings. Small acts of kindness, such as inviting them to social gatherings, sharing meals, or helping with basic needs, can make a world of difference to someone who has experienced loss and displacement.

**Donate and Fundraise:**

Financial contributions to reputable organizations working directly with refugees are invaluable. Donations can help provide shelter, food, medical aid, and education for displaced individuals. When Cohere partners with refugee-led organizations we support them through capacity strengthening, coordination, funding and advocacy initiatives. In 2022, we channeled $534,144 to refugee-led organisations across Africa. We are working to change the humanitarian response to shift power to refugees so their communities can be transformed. We believe they should be in the driving seat.

**Support Refugee-led Responses:**

Refugee leaders and organisations, who are our first responders play a critical role in supporting their communities as things continue to unfold across the country. These groups will be particularly vulnerable and need our support urgently. We have partnered with a number of refugee-led organizations who are working on the ground to help people fleeing the violence including I CAN SOUTH SUDAN, Sudanese Women for Peace and Development Association, and GRTR Uganda. Your support will help organisations provide safety and important supplies to those in need. [Donate here](https://cohere.enthuse.com/donate#).

**Support Local Refugee Businesses:**

Many refugees possess valuable skills, talents, and entrepreneurial spirits. Support their journey towards self-reliance by purchasing products or services from local refugee-owned businesses. Whether it's a restaurant, bakery, craft shop, or service-based venture, your support contributes to their livelihoods and fosters a sense of belonging in their new communities.



**Conclusion**

On World Refugee Day and every day, let us stand in solidarity with refugees worldwide. By educating ourselves, volunteering, [donating](https://reframe.network/discover.php), advocating, and showing empathy, we can help create a more compassionate and inclusive world for those seeking refuge. Remember, every action, no matter how small, has the power to transform lives and restore hope to those who need it most.
