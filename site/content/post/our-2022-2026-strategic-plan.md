Since 2008, we have been working with refugee communities in East Africa, implementing education and livelihoods programmes with a range of donors and partners. We have partnered with refugee leaders since 2012 and are currently working with 33 refugee-led organisations (RLOs) in Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria. 

At Cohere, we want to see a world in which everyone has control over their own future. Especially refugees. Our mission is to unleash the potential of refugees to determine their own futures on their own terms. 

The 2022-2026 Strategic Plan is not Cohere’s alone. It lays out a grand vision shared by the refugee-led organisations we are partnering with. It outlines our ambitious plan to support refugee leaders and innovators as they take more significant roles in the humanitarian response to refugee crises. In the plan, we show you how our model seeks to elevate and transfer power and funds to RLOs, including the strategies of some of our RLO partners.
